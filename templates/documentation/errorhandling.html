<!-- Summary: Error and Exception handling -->
<p>Applications based on the <b>UIM framework</b> have
    error and
    exception
    handling
    functions. The usage is slightly different from
    those in D.
    Errors are caught and displayed or logged. Uncaught
    exceptions
    are automatically rendered into error pages.</p>
<p>The Exception class from D is continued in the UM
    Framework as
    <a href="{{rooturl}}/api/classes/uimexception.html"><code>UIMException</code></a>. The Error class in D is
    retained, but the <code>UIMError</code>
    class is also introduced.</p>

<h2>
    Exception handling options</h2>
<p>Exception handling in uim provides several ways to
    customize
    exception handling. Each approach has different
    levels of
    control over the exception handling process.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Listen to events<br>
        This allows you to be notified of events when
        errors and
        exceptions have been handled.</li>
    <li>
        Custom Templates<br>This allows rendered view
        templates to
        be
        modified like any other template in the
        application.</li>
    <li>
        Custom controller<br>This can be used to control
        how
        exception pages are rendered.</li>
    <li>
        Custom ExceptionRenderer<br>This can be used to
        control how
        exception pages and logging are done.</li>
    <li>
        Create and register traps<br>This gives complete
        control
        over
        how errors and exceptions are handled, logged,
        and rendered.
    </li>
</ul>
