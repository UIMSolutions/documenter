<!-- Summary: How to use MVC Views -->
<p>Views are the V in MVC and are responsible for generating the requested output. 
    This is often in the form of HTML, XML or JSON, but streaming files and creating PDFs that users can download are also the responsibility of views. The uim framework has some built-in view classes for handling the most common rendering scenarios: To create XML or JSON web services, the JSON and XML views can be used. To serve protected or dynamically generated files, for example, "Send Files" can be used. To create multiple thematic views, "Themes" are a good option.</p>
